This function finds will search a directory tree for every file that contains a given string.

Compile the finds function by typing make at the shell prompt.

After compiling the program, type ./finds at the shell prompt to see propper formatting. 

The ./finds program has support for finding any standard string in a .S .c .h or any regular file. 

The ./finds program has support for using '.', '*', and '?' characters (max one 
of each as stated in the directions), but does not support the use of 
parenthesis () to further advance the pattern recognition. 

My version of finds does not include a custom printf() function, as I did not have time to get to this.
